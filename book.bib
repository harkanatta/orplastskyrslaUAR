@article{Fendall2009,
abstract = {Plastics pollution in the ocean is an area of growing concern, with research efforts focusing on both the macroplastic ({\textgreater}5 mm) and microplastic ({\textless}5 mm) fractions. In the 1990s it was recognized that a minor source of microplastic pollution was derived from liquid hand-cleansers that would have been rarely used by the average consumer. In 2009, however, the average consumer is likely to be using microplastic-containing products on a daily basis, as the majority of facial cleansers now contain polyethylene microplastics which are not captured by wastewater plants and will enter the oceans. Four microplastic-containing facial cleansers available in New Zealand supermarkets were used to quantify the size of the polythelene fragments. Three-quarters of the brands had a modal size of {\textless}100 microns and could be immediately ingested by planktonic organisms at the base of the food chain. Over time the microplastics will be subject to UV-degradation and absorb hydrophobic materials such as PCBs, making them smaller and more toxic in the long-term. Marine scientists need to educate the public to the dangers of using products that pose an immediate and long-term threat to the health of the oceans and the food we eat. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We investigated the physical and chemical properties of non-exhaust coarse and fine particles generated by on-road driving and in a laboratory setting using a mobile sampling system. The on-road driving and laboratory measurements performed under constant speed driving revealed that particles produced by tire wear had a size distribution in the range of 2-3. $\mu$m, while roadway particles (RWPs) measured behind the front tire during on-road driving largely comprised crustal materials such as road surface wear particles and road dust as well as tire wear particles (TWPs). The mode diameters of particles obtained from on-road driving under cornering conditions were similar to those obtained under constant speed conditions, but with higher concentrations of crustal elements. Under braking conditions, the particulate matter (PM) concentrations of brake wear particles (BWPs) sampled near the brake pad increased significantly and were much higher than the concentration of RWPs during deceleration, indicating that BWPs are one of the main sources of non-exhaust emissions. In addition, BWPs observed from on-road and laboratory measurements had a broader PM size range (1-10. $\mu$m) than RWPs. Size-segregated chemical analysis of PM samples indicated that the concentrations of Fe and Ca were highest in the coarse fraction emitted under constant speed and cornering conditions, while Fe, Ba, and Ti were most abundant in the fine fraction emitted during braking events. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Pakula2010,
abstract = {Washing laundry is one of the most widespread housework in the world. Today, washing machines do this work in many private households, using water, electricity, chemical substances, and process time. Although energy efficiency is in the focus of many regulations which have already achieved significant improvements, the question remains, how relevant these processes are in terms of the absolute impact on resources and whether there are possibilities to improve even further by looking abroad. This survey, which is based on published data, compares the energy and water consumption for automatic laundry washing in an average private household with the total energy and water consumption of private households. Only little data are available on resource consumption for laundry washing and reliable figures based on in-use measurements are hard to obtain. But although some of the data in this report are poor, this is the first work that tries to elucidate the contribution of automatic laundry washing to the total electricity and water consumption of households in selected countries worldwide. The report estimates the resource consumption of roughly 590,000,000 washing machines in 38 countries with about 2.3 billion people, which is about one third of the world population. The results of this work show that laundry washing in private households is done with quite different amounts of electricity and water in different parts of the world both in absolute and relative comparison to the overall household consumption. But due to different consumer habits in dealing with the achieved washing performance in the different global regions, the best practice in washing laundry in a most sustainable way cannot be determined yet. Further research is needed to form a basis for a most sustainable development of resource consumption in private households. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {D ue to their ubiquitous distribution and chemical composition, microplastics (MPs) are increasingly being recognized as a global concern. While it is widely acknowledged that MPs in the ocean are a serious issue with potentially negative effects on marine organisms, information about MPs in terrestrial and freshwater environments is fragmentary. Based on new MP emission estimates in industrialized countries, we suggest that widespread application of sewage sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to farmlands is likely to represent a major input of MPs to agricultural soils, with unknown consequences for sustainability and food security. Terrestrial emissions are the dominant source of MPs, including those conveyed to receiving waters by WWTP outfalls. Recent reports based on product life cycle data 1−3 offer the first quantitative insights into national MP emission inventories. MPs originate predominantly from automobile tire wear, household and laundry dust, industrial processes (e.g., blasting and deflashing of plastics), and through deterioration of surfaces made of or coated with plastic, for example, artificial turf and polymeric paint. Most of these emissions occur in urban and residential areas. In developed regions, municipal/industrial effluents and even diffuse urban runoff are eventually conveyed to WWTPs. During wastewater treatment, over 90{\%} of MPs are retained in sewage sludge. 4 Effectiveness of MP retention is dependent on particle density and size. MPs with a density greater than water are almost completely retained in sewage sludge during primary and secondary treatment. Tertiary filtration treatment effectively removes larger floating particles, while smaller and lighter particles, expectedly, are released with wastewater effluents. The use of sewage sludge as fertilizer for agricultural applications is often economically advantageous and is common in many developed regions. In Europe and North America about 50{\%} of sewage sludge is processed for agricultural use. Using national data on farm areas, population and sewage sludge fate (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat), with estimates of MP emis-sions 1−3 and applying broad but conservative uncertainty ranges, we estimate that between 125 and 850 tons MP/million inhabitants are added annually to European agricultural soils either through direct application of sewage sludge or as processed biosolids. This is at least equal to, and probably much higher than our estimate of 110 to 180 tons MP/million inhabitants emitted annually to surface waters based on refs 1−3. In Europe, in fact, between 1270 and 2130 tons MPs/million inhabitants are released to urban environments, annually. Conservatively assuming that 10−90{\%} of MPs produced from road wear and debris from building coating are collected by sewers, between 360 and 1980 tons MPs are expected to reach municipal WWTPs. Here, an uncertain fraction of MPs from car tire debris (conservatively, 20−80{\%}) and {\textgreater}90{\%} of MPs from personal care products are likely to be retained in sludge, 4 giving a total input of between 250 and 1700 tons/million inhabitants each year. Sludge application to agricultural land was calculated as the sum of direct application and application of processed biosolids, excluding the fraction of wastewater sludge incinerated, disposed in landfills or subject to other nonagricultural uses. These figures are highly conservative as sludge is only ever applied to a small percentage of agricultural land. There is a broad range of sludge application rates and intensities to European agricultural land (Figure 1). Application rates (estimated as compost plus direct application) range from 0 to 91{\%}, with an average of 43{\%}. This equates to average and maximum areal per-capita loadings of 0.2 and 8 mg MP/ha/yr. MPs inputs estimated here possibly reflect the situation in other countries with similar socioeconomic conditions and/or similar use of plastics (e.g., in Asia and the Americas). A rough extrapolation from data in refs 1−3 produces a total yearly input of 63 000−430 000 and 44 000−300 000 tons MPs to European and North American farmlands, respectively. This would be an alarmingly high input. Comprehensively, this exceeds the total accumulated burden of 93 000−236 000 tons MPs currently estimated to be present in surface water in the global oceans. 5},

@article{Amato2010,
abstract = {Given the absence of a definitive threshold for atmospheric particulate matter (PM)-induced adverse health effects and the evidence of road traffic as a main contributor to PM-urban levels, there is a general agreement in reducing PM-associated health risks by firstly focusing on vehicle traffic sector. Beside the reduction of primary exhaust emissions, recent potential measures are challenging to reduce emissions of particulate matter from abrasion and resuspension processes given the high potential health burden of heavy metals and metalloids sourced by vehicle-wear particles (brakes, tires, rotor, discs and catalysts) and of coarse particles (PM2.5-10).Some mitigating measures can be adopted in order to reduce road dust emissions from paved roads by removing or binding those particles already deposited and easy to be resuspended by traffic-generated turbulence. Sweeping, water flushing and use of chemical suppressants are usually more commonly employed to try to diminish emissions, but evaluating the effectiveness of preventive measures on improving air quality is a difficult task, consequently there is a general dearth of information about their effectiveness in reducing ambient PM concentrations. In particular, the scientific bibliography seems to be particularly scarce, whilst most of the information comes from local authorities committees. Consequently the existing reports are often aimed only to the municipalities and in the native language, with an objective difficulty for the international scientific community to access to them.For this review we have gathered contributions from some of major experts in this field, with the purpose of taking advantage of their background and personal awareness about any kind of related reports even not in English. Furthermore, the results we have gathered are often dissimilar, probably due to the different local conditions (weather, road pavement conditions etc.), therefore another objective of the review is to make a balance of actual knowledge and create a useful reference for future research studies and air quality management. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

But, their generation, fate, fragmentation and their propensity to sorb/release persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are determined by the characteristics of the polymers that constitutes them. Yet, physico-chemical characteristics of the polymers making up the MPs have not received detailed attention in published work. This review assesses the relevance of selected characteristics of plastics that composes the microplastics, to their role as a pollutant with potentially serious ecological impacts.

@article{Barnes2009,
abstract = {One of the most ubiquitous and long-lasting recent changes to the surface of our planet is the accumulation and fragmentation of plastics. Within just a few decades since mass production of plastic products commenced in the 1950s, plastic debris has accumulated in terrestrial environments, in the open ocean, on shorelines of even the most remote islands and in the deep sea. Annual clean-up operations, costing millions of pounds sterling, are now organized in many countries and on every continent. Here we document global plastics production and the accumulation of plastic waste. While plastics typically constitute approximately 10 per cent of discarded waste, they represent a much greater proportion of the debris accumulating on shorelines. Mega- and macro-plastics have accumulated in the highest densities in the Northern Hemisphere, adjacent to urban centres, in enclosed seas and at water convergences (fronts). We report lower densities on remote island shores, on the continental shelf seabed and the lowest densities (but still a documented presence) in the deep sea and Southern Ocean. The longevity of plastic is estimated to be hundreds to thousands of years, but is likely to be far longer in deep sea and non-surface polar environments. Plastic debris poses considerable threat by choking and starving wildlife, distributing non-native and potentially harmful organisms, absorbing toxic chemicals and degrading to micro-plastics that may subsequently be ingested. Well-established annual surveys on coasts and at sea have shown that trends in mega- and macro-plastic accumulation rates are no longer uniformly increasing: rather stable, increasing and decreasing trends have all been reported. The average size of plastic particles in the environment seems to be decreasing, and the abundance and global distribution of micro-plastic fragments have increased over the last few decades. However, the environmental consequences of such microscopic debris are still poorly understood.},

Floats from aquaculture facilities and docks were heavily damaged by thousands of isopods and their burrows. Multiple sites in Asia, Australia, Panama, and the USA exhibited evidence of isopod damage. One isopod creates thousands of microplastic particles when excavating a burrow; colonies can expel millions of particles. Microplastics similar in size to these particles may facilitate the spread of non-native species or be ingested by organisms causing physical or toxicological harm. Extruded polystyrene inhibited boring, suggesting this foam may prevent damage in the field.

Studies of microlitter impacts are mostly based on virgin and spherical polymer particles as model MP. However, in pelagic and benthic environments, surfaces are always colonized by microorgan-isms forming so-called biofilms. The influence of such biofilms on the fate and potential effects of MP is not understood well. Here, we review the physical interactions of early microbial colonization on plastic surfaces and their reciprocal influence on the weathering processes and vertical transport as well as sorption and release of contaminants by MP. Possible ecological consequences of biofilm formation on MP, such as trophic transfer of MP particles and potential adverse effects of MP, are virtually unknown. However, evidence is accumulating that the biofilm−plastic interactions have the capacity to influence the fate and impacts of MP by modifying the physical properties of the particles. There is an urgent research need to better understand these interactions and increase the ecological relevance of current laboratory testing by simulating field conditions in which microbial life is a key driver of biogeochemical processes.},

abstract = {Since polymeric materials do not decompose easily, disposal of waste polymers is a serious environmental concern. Widespread studies on the biodegradation of rubbers have been carried out in order to overcome the environmental problems associated with rubber waste. This report provides an overview on the microbial degradation of natural and synthetic rubbers. Rubber degrading microbes, bacteria and fungi, are ubiquitous in the environment especially soil. The qualitative data like plate assay, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and Sturm test indicated that both natural and synthetic rubbers can be degraded by microorganisms. It has confirmed that the enzymes latex clearing protein (Lcp) and rubber oxygenase A (RoxA) are responsible for the degradation of natural and synthetic rubbers. Lcp was obtained from Gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces sp. strain K30 and RoxA from Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas sp. strain 35Y. Analysis of degradation products of natural and synthetic rubbers indicated the oxidative cleavage of double bonds in polymer backbone. Aldehydes, ketones and other carbonyl groups were detected as degradation products from cultures of various rubber degrading strains. This review emphasizes the importance of biodegradation in environmental biotechnology for waste rubber disposal. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Tire-tread material has a zinc (Zn) content of about 1 wt {\%}. The quantity of tread material lost to road surfaces by abrasion has not been well characterized. Two approaches were used to assess the magnitude of this nonpoint source of Zn in the U.S. for the period 1936-1999. In the first approach, tread-wear rates from the automotive engineering literature were used in conjunction with vehicle distance-driven data from the U.S. Department of Transportation to determine Zn releases. A second approach calculated this source term from the volume of tread lost during lifetime tire wear. These analyses showed that the quantity of Zn released by tire wear in the mid-1990s was of the same magnitude as that released from waste incineration. For 1999, the quantity of Zn released by tire wear in the U.S. is estimated to be 10 000-11 000 metric tons. A specific case study focused on Zn sources and sinks in an urban-suburban watershed (Lake Anne) in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area for a time period of the late 1990s. The atmospheric flux of total Zn (wet deposition) to the watershed was 2 µg/cm 2 /yr. The flux of Zn to the watershed estimated from tire wear was 42 µg/cm 2 /yr. The measured accumulation rate of total Zn in age-dated sediment cores from Lake Anne was 27 µg/cm 2 /yr. These data suggest that tire-wear Zn inputs to urban-suburban watersheds can be significantly greater than atmospheric inputs, although the watershed appears to retain appreciable quantities of vehicular Zn inputs.},

abstract = {Abstract The efficiency of the gas cleaning step is one of the fundamental steps to the successful operation of biomass gasification technologies for power generation. In the present study, catalytic cracking is selected as the hot gas cleaning technology using zeolite HZSM-5 catalyst in order to reduce tar produced from palm shells gasification in the laboratory scale fixed bed reactor. The experimental conditions for average biomass particle size, nitrogen flow rate and percentage of zeolite HZSM-5 catalyst are in the range of 1.18–7.13 mm, 3–7 L/min, and 2–10 wt{\%} respectively with constant air flow rate of 5 L/min to the inlet of the reactor. From the gas chromatographic analysis of the tar produced from the gasification process, it is found that the phenol in the tar is in the range of 5–8 vol{\%} when the oxygen to nitrogen flow rate ratio is varied from 0.10 to 0.15. A decreasing trend in the phenol concentration is observed when oxygen to nitrogen ratio is increased. The overall oxygenated aromatic compounds in the tar content are comparable when operating with oxygen to nitrogen ratio of 0.12 and 0.15. The lowest concentration of phenol is achieved when 5 wt{\%} of zeolite HZSM-5 catalyst is used with a reduction of 99{\%} and 79{\%} for oxygen to nitrogen ratio of 0.10 or 0.15 respectively when compared to the phenol concentration with the absence of the catalyst. Furthermore, higher percentage of the catalyst results in less chemical compounds found in tar. Tar content increased as lower concentration of oxygen content in gas mixture or larger palm shells particle size is used.},

Plastic contamination was found to be high in Nephrops, 83{\%} of the animals sampled contained plastics (predominately filaments) in their stomachs. Tightly tangled balls of plastic strands were found in 62{\%} of the animals studied but were least prevalent in animals which had recently moulted. No significant difference in plastic load was observed between males and females. Raman spectroscopy indicated that some of the microfilaments identified from gut contents could be sourced to fishing waste. Nephrops fed fish seeded with strands of polypropylene rope were found to ingest but not to excrete the strands. The fishery for Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, is the most valuable in Scotland and the high prevalence of plastics in Nephrops may have implications for the health of the stock. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Restrepo-Florez2014,
abstract = {The ability of microorganisms to use polyethylene as a carbon source has only been recently established. This result has significance both from an environmental point of view, due to the accumulation of millions of tons of waste plastics every year, but also regarding the conservation of integrity for infrastructures incorporating this plastic. A number of microorganisms with the ability to grow on polyethylene have been isolated. The effects of these microorganisms on the physiochemical properties of this polymer have been described; these include changes in crystallinity, molecular weight, topography of samples and the functional groups found on the surface. Although the bio-degradation and bio-deterioration of polyethylene has been demonstrated by several researchers, the enzymes involved and mechanisms associated with these phenomena are still unclear. Nevertheless, it is recognized that both enzymatic and abiotic factors (such UV light) can mediate the initial oxidation of polyethylene chains, and given the chemical similarity between polyethylene and olefins it has been suggested that the metabolic pathways for degradation of hydrocarbons can be used once the size of polyethylene molecules decrease to an acceptable range for enzyme action (typically from 10 to 50 carbons). The long-range structure and morphology of polyethylene have shown important roles, with amorphous regions being more prone to microbial attack than crystalline ones. This review focuses on the recent hypotheses and experimental findings regarding the biodegradation of polyethylene. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The amount of Atlantic water (AW) present on the shelf north of Iceland is highly variable and influences the local biological productivity. Estimates of the volume and heat transports of AW to the North Icelandic Shelf between 1994 and 2000 are presented here. On average, 66{\%} of the eastward flow on the Hornbanki section consists of AW with a transport of AW of approximately 0.75 Sv. The associated heat transport is 19 TW. There are large interannual variations in the transports, from over 1 Sv in the summers of 1997, 1999, and 2000 to almost no AW transport in February/March 1995. The seasonal variation in the transport has an amplitude of 0.2 Sv with a minimum in February/March and maximum during late spring and summer. Larval cod are carried by this flow from the main spawning grounds south of Iceland to the nursery grounds on the North Icelandic Shelf. The increasing abundance and the better condition of cod larvae after 1997 are related to the increase of the AW inflow then. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

In Part I of this study, a baseline watershed-scale MP mass balance model was developed for tire and road wear particles (TRWP) in the Seine watershed. In Part II, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis (SA) methods were used to identify the parameters that determine the transport of these particles to the estuary. Local differential, local range and global first-order variance-based SA identified similar key parameters. The global SA (1000 Monte Carlo simulations) indicated that most of the variance in TRWP exported to the estuary can be apportioned to TRWP diameter (76%), TRWP density (5.6%), the fraction of TRWP directed to combined sewers with treatment (3.9%), and the fraction of TRWP distributed to runoff (versus roadside soil; 2.2%). The export fraction was relatively insensitive to heteroaggregation processes and the rainfall intensity threshold for road surface washoff. The fraction of TRWP exported to estuary in the probabilistic assessment was centered on the baseline estimate of 2%. This fraction ranged from 1.4 to 4.9% (central tendency defined as 25th to 75th percentile) and 0.97% to 13% (plausible upper bound defined as 10th to 90th percentiles). This study emphasizes the importance of in situ characterization of TRWP diameter and density, and confirms the baseline mass balance presented in Part I, which indicated an appreciable potential for capture of TRWP in freshwater sediment."

@article{Arajo2002,
abstract = {Reducing the residual monomer content is a desire of every polymer producer, as a product with no or very low levels of residual monomer would have a different commercial appeal. The presence of residual monomer may create hazards to workers as a result of long-term exposure during polymer processing and sometimes even to customers. There are several techniques for reducing residual monomer content and the industrial importance that has been given to the presence of residual monomers in polymeric products is reflected in the number of patents involving residual monomer reduction techniques. Nevertheless, choosing the best, or the most adequate, technique is not always an easy task, and one still observes a relative lack of scientific literature on this subject. The technique to be employed will depend upon polymer application, which determines the grade of purity, and also on polymer quality, as some monomer reducing techniques might change polymer properties. The main objective of this review is to summarize and discuss the principal methods employed for reducing residual monomer content.},

@book{Bergmann2015,
abstract = {For decades we have learned about the physical hazards associated with plastic debris in the marine environment, but recently we are beginning to realize the chemical hazards. Assessing hazards associated with plastic in aquatic habitats is not simple, and requires knowledge regarding organisms that may be exposed, the exposure concentrations, the types of polymers comprising the debris, the length of time the debris was present in the aquatic environment (affecting the size, shape and fouling) and the locations and transport of the debris during that time period. Marine plastic debris is associated with a ‘cocktail of chemicals, including chemicals added or produced during manufacturing and those present in the marine environment that accumulate onto the debris from surrounding seawater. This raises concerns regarding: (i) the complex mixture of chemical substances associated with marine plastic debris, (ii) the environmental fate of these chemicals to and from plastics in our oceans and (iii) how this mixture affects wildlife, as hundreds of species ingest this material in nature. The focus of this chapter is on the mixture of chemicals associated with marine plastic debris. Specifically, this chapter discusses the diversity of chemical ingredients, byproducts of manufacturing and sorbed chemical contaminants from the marine environment among plastic types, the role of marine plastic debris as a novel medium for environmental partitioning of chemical contaminants in the ocean and the toxic effects that may result from plastic debris in marine animals.},

However, there is still a lack of standardisation, and therefore, used methodologies varied widely. Most researchers performed controversially discussed visual examination, but it became more and more a supporting tool to reduce measuring effort. To that account, especially infrared or Raman microscopy were used for chemical characterisation. This indicates that dimensions of analysed microplastics changed to micrometre scaling. However, those microscopy technologies were used for particle by particle characterisation, and therefore, it is still challenging to handle the mass of data. Alternatively, thermal extraction and desorption gas chromatography is a useful integrating analysis approach, which allows a multicomponent characterisation of environmental samples without any complex sample preparation."

A meta-analysis on tire components in the environment revealed that tire wear particles are present in all environmental compartments, including air, water, soils/sediments, and biota. The maximum Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PECs) of tire wear particles in surface waters range from 0.03 to 56 mg l-1and the maximum PECs in sediments range from 0.3 to 155 g kg-1d.w. The results from our previous long-term studies with Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were used to derive Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNECs). The upper ranges for PEC/PNEC ratios in water and sediment were {\textgreater}1, meaning that tire wear particles present potential risks for aquatic organisms. We suggest that management should be directed towards development and production of more environmentally friendly tires and improved road runoff treatment. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Polymer particles with an upper size limit of 5 mm and a lower limit of 50 μm (micrometres), were included. Samples were analysed by FT-IR spectroscopy. Most samples tested positive for multiple microplastics. Compared to other quantified sources of microplastics such as raw or treated sewage, landfill leachates are likely to be a relatively small source of microplastic particles between 5000 and 50 µm. Variations in particle count extends, however, over several orders of magnitude. Variability and potential effects of microplastics in landfill leachates, including particles &lt;50µm, should be focus of future studies. },

The identification technique lacks a standardized protocol. Herein, stereomicroscope and Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FT-IR) identification methods for microplastics (<1mm) were compared using the same samples from the sea surface microlayer (SML) and beach sand. Fragmented microplastics were significantly (p<0.05) underestimated and fiber was significantly overestimated using the stereomicroscope both in the SML and beach samples. The total abundance by FT-IR was higher than by microscope both in the SML and beach samples, but they were not significantly (p>0.05) different. Depending on the number of samples and the microplastic size range of interest, the appropriate identification method should be determined; selecting a suitable identification method for microplastics is crucial for evaluating microplastic pollution."

The NR staining method was successfully applied to micro-sized polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyurethane, and poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate), except for polyvinylchloride, polyamide and polyester. The recovery rate of polyethylene (100–300μm) spiked to pretreated natural sand was 98% in the NR stating method, which was not significantly (p<0.05) different with FT-IR identification. The NR staining method was suitable for discriminating fragmented polypropylene particles from large numbers of sand particles in laboratory weathering test samples. The method is straightforward and quick for identifying and quantifying polymer particles in the laboratory controlled samples. Further studies, however, are necessary to investigate the application of NR staining to field samples with organic remnants."

abstract = "Riverine transport to the marine environment is an important pathway for microplastic. However, information on fate and transport of nano- and microplastic in freshwater systems is lacking. Here we present scenario studies on the fate and transport of nano-to millimetre sized spherical particles like microbeads (100 nm–10 mm) with a state of the art spatiotemporally resolved hydrological model. The model accounts for advective transport, homo- and heteroaggregation, sedimentation-resuspension, polymer degradation, presence of biofilm and burial. Literature data were used to parameterize the model and additionally the attachment efficiency for heteroaggregation was determined experimentally. The attachment efficiency ranged from 0.004 to 0.2 for 70 nm and 1050 nm polystyrene particles aggregating with kaolin or bentonite clays in natural freshwater. Modeled effects of polymer density (1–1.5 kg/L) and biofilm formation were not large, due to the fact that variations in polymer density are largely overwhelmed by excess mass of suspended solids that form heteroaggregates with microplastic. Particle size had a dramatic effect on the modeled fate and retention of microplastic and on the positioning of the accumulation hot spots in the sediment along the river. Remarkably, retention was lowest (18–25%) for intermediate sized particles of about 5 μm, which implies that the smaller submicron particles as well as larger micro- and millimetre sized plastic are preferentially retained. Our results suggest that river hydrodynamics affect microplastic size distributions with profound implications for emissions to marine systems."
